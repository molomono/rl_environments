# Reinforcement learning environments
## This repository is currently a WIP
This repository contains a variety of gym environments. The primary focus is to design training environments that can be used to pre-train an Agent. 

- Open AI Gym is used to handle the environments
- PyBullet and V-REP are used as simulators (although in the future Gazebo might be added)

This is a WIP and i'm working in the master branch, that is subject to change as is the content of this repository.
